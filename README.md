# particlesjs-demo
A fairly simple demonstration of particles.js, for the purpose of possibly implementing it into future projects.

I previously made a version with more transformations and filters, and while it was pretty to see on desktop, it experienced performance issues on mobile. I may continue playing around with particles.js in hope of inventing more intricate patterns without impacting performance on mobile devices.
